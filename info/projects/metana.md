# Metana Bootcamp



As I was getting ready to take a [work break](https://www.danielmathieson.com/info/career/work-break) in late 2022, I was becoming increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology that made them possible. After starting an AI/ML bootcamp, I realized that I would have more than enough time to add on another bootcamp into my time given how easy the beginning of that other course was. I'm glad I did add something, particularly this bootcamp. The faculty & team behind the bootcamps were extremely friendly, available, and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to learn Solidity.

The main takeaways I had from the course was not learning how to write smart contracts though. In fact, I don't foresee myself writing another smart contract for a long time. Wheat I learned about the most in this course was how to be a professional developer (filling up the GitHub contribution graph), and how to build front-ends for applications. I had always relied on dashboarding software to build the front end of any analysis I had done in my career previously. Web3 had (and still has as of this writing) serious UX issues, so a lot of the course focused on making sure we could solve those problems elegantly. This was my first time using react seriously, which would come in handy for many other project later.
