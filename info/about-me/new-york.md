# Moving to New York City


After completing college, I was initially open to the idea of working anywhere but New York City. Coming from a smaller city and attending college in a small town, I had concerns about living in the bustling city that never sleeps. However, everything changed when I received a job offer from my dream company in the summer of 2016. I accepted the offer while visiting family in San Francisco and soon found myself moving to northern New Jersey to live with relatives, just a few weeks later.

I resided in northern New Jersey for approximately four months before the daily commute to the city became too burdensome. At that point, I decided to move in with my former college roommate in the Murray Hill area of Manhattan in December 2016. Our apartment was conveniently located within walking distance of the FanDuel offices, situated around the Gramercy Park and Madison Square Park areas.


# Early Years


Living in New York City, particularly in Murray Hill, provided me with an environment that demanded hard work and fostered a strong sense of energy. My roommate Zach's dedication and work ethic motivated me to keep pace. Additionally, I was fortunate to have a few close friends from college in the area, which made exploring the city together a lot of fun. Although I didn't venture outside of Manhattan frequently, I did visit my family during holidays and summers.


# The East Village


After spending two years in Murray Hill, Zach and I decided to seek a new experience and moved to the East Village. Although the apartment was smaller, I developed a fondness for it. It was still conveniently located near my workplace, allowing me to walk to the office without relying on the subway every morning. With a better understanding of the subway system, I could easily access various parts of the city from the Union Square Park stations.

However, after a year and a half in the East Village, I started to miss certain aspects of life. New York City was centered around dining out and visiting bars, but I yearned for more outdoor experiences and a connection with nature. As I underwent career changes, met my girlfriend Maggie, and my roommate prepared to move out, I saw it as an opportune time to explore new possibilities elsewhere. When a job opportunity arose in the Bay Area, it seemed perfectâ€”a place that offered more outdoor opportunities while still being a vibrant city like San Francisco. I seized the chance to have Google cover my relocation expenses and never looked back. Although I cherished my time in NYC, I must admit that I prefer San Francisco.
