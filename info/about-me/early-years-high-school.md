# Intro


I spent my early years in Fox Chapel, a suburb of Pittsburgh, PA. During that time, I developed a strong passion for sports and video games. I was particularly fond of Nintendo and the Legend of Zelda series. My love for Pittsburgh sports teams, especially the Steelers, was also a significant part of my childhood.

In my family, I have an older sister and two younger brothers who are close in age. We had the opportunity to go on various vacations to different parts of the world, such as Ireland, Africa, and Peru. Our family bond was strong, and we spent a lot of time together. I hope to create a similar close-knit family in the future. Even though my parents divorced after I finished college, we still maintain a close relationship, frequently gathering for holidays and summer vacations. However, it has become more challenging as we have all grown older, with my dad residing in Bozeman, MT, and my mom living in Asheville, NC.


# High School


I attended [Shady Side Academy](https://www.shadysideacademy.org/) for high school, where I actively participated in soccer and lacrosse, though with varying levels of success. Additionally, I had a deep appreciation for mathematics and science. My high school experience was memorable, and there were a few remarkable teachers, courses, and experiences worth mentioning.

### Philosophy with Dr. Sutula
#### Description
Taking a philosophy course in high school was a rare opportunity, and I was eager to enroll. Dr. Sutula, who had also been my geometry teacher, employed a unique teaching approach. He would begin each unit with an open-ended question or problem, allowing us to explore and find answers without knowing the specific topic of study. While we eventually covered core geometry concepts, it was the emphasis on first-principles thinking that left a lasting impact on me. In the philosophy course, we delved into the relationship between Plato and Aristotle for a month and a half, explored fallacies and logic concepts for a month, and gained a broader perspective on the world.

### Pre-Calc with Ms. Whitney
#### Description
Ms. Whitney, my pre-calculus teacher, stands out as a teacher who genuinely cared about her students. Pre-calculus was the first time I encountered difficulty with a math concept, leaving me unsure of how to study for quizzes and exams, as I had never faced such challenges before. The first quiz on derivatives caught me off guard, and I ended up glancing at my neighbor's paper in a panic. Instead of reprimanding me, Ms. Whitney turned it into a learning experience. She taught me the importance of applying myself outside of class and the value of seeking help when facing challenges.

### Senior Year Lacrosse
#### Description
Having played soccer throughout my childhood, I decided to try lacrosse during my freshman year of high school. Although I struggled with stick skills and offensive play, I found my niche in defense, particularly as a short-stick defender. This position required hustle, intelligence, and doing the "dirty work" to help the team succeed. By my senior year, I couldn't imagine playing any other position. The experience taught me the value of contributing in ways that may go unnoticed but significantly impact the team's success. To this day, I embrace the role of a dedicated, all-around team player.


# Camp Deerwood


During the summers, I attended and worked at [Camp Deerwood](https://campdeerwood.com/), an all-boys camp in New Hampshire. This experience taught me the importance of being a contributing member of a community, how to work with people of different ages, and allowed me to form lifelong friendships. I spent four summers as a camper and three summers as a counselor, working in kayaking and driving the water skiing boat. Camp Deerwood holds a special place in my heart, and I often visit as my family has a house on the lake. My youngest brother continues to work as a counselor there every summer, further strengthening our connection to the camp.
