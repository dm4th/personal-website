# The Search Process

When the time came to choose a college, I initially wanted to explore options beyond my parents' alma mater, [Bucknell](https://www.bucknell.edu/). However, as I visited various campuses with my family, I couldn't help but make comparisons to Bucknell, which had always been my benchmark for what a college should look like. The combination of a strong engineering program and a robust liberal arts college made the decision a no-brainer after some introspection.


# Picking a Major


Upon arriving on campus, I was an undeclared engineering major, which was a common path at [Bucknell](https://www.bucknell.edu/), particularly due to the introductory course, Engineering 100. This course was mandatory for all first-semester engineering students, regardless of their intended major. It consisted of four courses: Calculus (level depending on potential AP credits), Physics I, a Foundation Seminar, and ENG 100.

ENG 100 provided a glimpse into the different engineering disciplines offered at Bucknell by rotating students through three disciplines over nine weeks. While all three rotations (Biomedical, Electrical, and Computer Science) were fascinating, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering stood out to me. Rather than making an immediate choice between the two, I discovered the [Computer Engineering major](https://coursecatalog.bucknell.edu/collegeofengineeringcurricula/areasofstudy/computerengineeringcpeg/#majortext), which offered a curriculum that encompassed elements of both disciplines. This allowed me to pursue Computer Engineering until the end of my sophomore year and then decide whether to specialize further in software or hardware.


# Computer Engineering


As the saying goes, "the best-laid plans often go astray." In my case, I never deviated from the [Computer Engineering]https://coursecatalog.bucknell.edu/collegeofengineeringcurricula/areasofstudy/computerengineeringcpeg/#majortext) track at [Bucknell](https://www.bucknell.edu/). I relished the fact that there were only six students in the entire major, making it the smallest program within the College of Engineering. The curriculum encompassed a wide range of topics, from understanding electrical signals to delving into higher-level abstraction concepts like data structures. I gained a comprehensive understanding of how computers functioned, which was particularly fulfilling for me.

Overall, the Computer Engineering program at Bucknell was exceptional. It offered a diverse range of disciplines and provided a comprehensive understanding of the digital world that surrounds us. It comes as no surprise that the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Bucknell has been ranked highly by U.S. News & World Report.

### Operating Systems
#### Key Technologies
- C
- Python
- Assembly Language
- Threading and Multiprocessing
#### Description
This course served as the practical application of my knowledge. With a talented instructor, I found the topics of multiprocessing and threading particularly intriguing.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
#### Key Technologies
- Python
- Advanced Data Structures
- Advanced Computer Algorithms
#### Description 
This course provided a deeper understanding of how systems operate at a fundamental level. I was captivated by the various methods to benchmark algorithms, analyze run-times, and consider storage constraints.

### Entrepreneurial Engineering
#### Description 
This course emphasized the importance of execution alongside ideation. Working with a group of non-engineers in a startup pitch competition, I assumed sole responsibility for the technical aspects. Although I may not have fully comprehended the complexities of our pitch at the time, it proved to be an invaluable learning experience.

### Digital Systems and Circuits
#### Key Technologies
- Verilog
- FPGA Development
- Binary & Assembly Langueage coding
#### Description
I found circuit design to be immensely gratifying. It involved solving mathematical puzzles and obtaining precise measurements to validate correctness. This course took my understanding of circuit design to the next level by incorporating the processing of input AC signals into digital outputs and vice versa. It required innovative thinking and enhanced my ability to design complex systems.

### Senior Capstone Project
#### Key Technologies
- Android Development
- Mesh Networks
- Bluetooth
- Web Development
#### Description
As a senior in the Computer Engineering program, I embarked on a year-long capstone project, collaborating with the electrical department. Although, to be completely honest, I felt that I did not contribute adequately to the project compared to my teammates.

In the project, I served as the project manager for a team tasked with building a mobile gaming console named MAGE. It comprised a primitive Android app and four "nodes" that could be reconfigured for different games. Each node featured a gyroscope, a button, and various colored lights. Our team developed two example games:

- **Bop-It** - Nodes illuminated different colors, and the app instructed players to "shake," "press," or "flip" the corresponding node.
- **Capture the Nodes** - Nodes were lit with different colors, and pressing a node changed it to the opposing team's color. The team with the most nodes of their color at the end of a designated period won the game.
This project provided me with valuable leadership experience. Although I may not have been the most knowledgeable team member, I learned how to guide a group of exceptionally talented engineers toward a common goal.
