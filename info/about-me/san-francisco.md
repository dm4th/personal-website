Start: January, 2020

# Moving to the Bay Area


In early 2020, I made the move to the Bay Area with the assistance of a moving stipend from Google. Initially, I lived in Sunnyvale, near the Google Cloud campus. I enjoyed the autonomy that came with living there, but being hours away from anyone became isolating. After three months, which was the maximum duration Google would cover for corporate housing, I decided to relocate to San Francisco, just as the COVID-19 pandemic was starting to impact the world.


# Moving to San Francisco and COVID

I moved into a house in the Mission neighborhood with three roommates, including my younger cousin Drew, as well as Chris and Tarek. We quickly formed a strong bond during the months we spent together in lockdown. Despite the challenges brought about by COVID-19, I adapted well to living in a new city because everyone else was also confined to their homes. Maintaining long-distance communication with old friends became easier, and my girlfriend Maggie joined me in San Francisco, living just a few blocks away in the Castro neighborhood. Having her by my side made the transition and life during this time much more enjoyable.

I lived with these roommates for two years, appreciating the youthful energy they brought into my daily routine. However, by August 2022, I felt the need for more privacy and moved out, coinciding with a decline in motivation at my job at Action. I truly loved the Mission neighborhood, and I highly recommend it to anyone considering a move to San Francisco from out of town.


# The Richmond and Maggie


In August 2022, my girlfriend Maggie, our dog Winnie (a border collie), and I moved to our current home in the Richmond neighborhood, close to Clement Street. It's an ideal location for us, particularly with Golden Gate Park and the Presidio nearby, providing a dream environment for Winnie. Living with Maggie has significantly improved my quality of life. The challenges of managing belongings and navigating separate spaces dissolve when you can share everything with your partner. The Richmond neighborhood may be quieter and foggier compared to where we previously lived, but it suits us perfectly.

This period has also been an interesting transition for me personally. During our time in the new apartment, I have been taking classes and working at an after-school coding teaching school for kids. Not having a full-time job has been a departure from what I'm used to, as I thrive on having a constant project to occupy my mind. However, this break has been an important period of growth for me, and I'm grateful for the experience. With that said, I am now ready for the next chapter in my life.
