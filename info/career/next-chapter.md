# What I'm Seeking


Above all, I aspire to contribute to a company or project that instills a sense of excitement in me every day. Throughout my career, and particularly in the last few months, I have cultivated a diverse array of skills at varying levels of proficiency. Although my skills in data analysis are top-notch, I acknowledge that my expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence isn't as strong as my abilities in SQL and modeling. Recently, I've gained significant insights into full-stack development, blockchain engineering, and the intricacies of launching a product, even though I lack formal career experience in these areas. The key takeaway from this site should be my readiness to think creatively and contribute to your objectives in any way I can. I hope this project effectively demonstrates that readiness.


# Weaknesses


Since my departure from the Action Network in October 2022, I've had ample time to reflect on areas where I can improve. These self-identified growth areas are more instructive of what I'm looking for in a future role than simply listing my strengths. While I believe I would thrive in a role that aligns with my strengths, it's important that you understand my areas of potential improvement first:
1. **People Pleasing** - While it might sound clich√©, my propensity to take on more tasks than I could effectively manage was a key challenge during my tenure as a manager at Action. This tendency initially emerged from my enthusiasm to assist others and solve problems, and it was reinforced by early career successes. However, the negative consequences became apparent when my team became overloaded due to my inability to say 'no'. In a role with a more focused scope or clearer responsibilities, I am confident that I can address this issue effectively.
2. **Over-Engineering** - I have a passion for delivering high-quality, polished products. However, this passion can be a hindrance when faced with tight deadlines. The analyst in me hesitates to deliver recommendations without a comprehensive data analysis, even when circumstances require swift action. This is an area I'm continuously working on improving.
3. **Prioritizing People over Ideas** - It's challenging for me to separate the merit of an idea from my assessment of the person proposing it. I've learned that great ideas can come from unexpected sources, and focusing too much on perceived importance can lead to overlooked opportunities. While company culture plays a significant role in addressing this issue, it's something I need to work on personally.


# Strengths


It's easier for anyone to discuss their strengths, and I'm no exception. I've always been one of the hardest-working and technically proficient members of my teams. Here are three key strengths that stand out, but I'm confident I can contribute to your team, project, or company in many additional ways:
1. **Teaching** - I have a knack for simplifying complex concepts, making them easy to grasp for diverse audiences. This skill has proven beneficial at FanDuel, where I regularly explained intricate aspects of the Daily Fantasy ecosystem to executives. At Google, I rapidly became a go-to resource for coworkers seeking to improve their use of internal tools. At Action, I dedicated significant time to educating others, from explaining business dynamics to executives, teaching python to my team, or informing the rest of the company about the financial impacts of their work. I have also been teaching coding to children in my free time. You can count on me to uplift the team's collective knowledge.
2. **Curiosity** - I'm intrinsically driven to learn and understand. Whether I'm delving into AI/ML and blockchain engineering, listening to tech, science, and business podcasts, or learning new skills to solve problems, my curiosity is always at the forefront. When I started at FanDuel, I didn't know SQL; now I'm an expert. My curiosity, combined with my teaching ability, assures you that our collaboration will foster a continuous learning environment.
3. **High EQ** - While I don't consider myself the best manager in the world, I know that people enjoy working with me and for me. I am a committed team player who cherishes a strong culture and understands the importance of emotional intelligence in the workplace. This is an area where many might claim proficiency, but I truly excel at understanding and empathizing with others.
