# Making the Leap


Making the transition from Google was challenging, even though it was the right time for a change. I had promised myself a minimum of two years at Google before contemplating a move, and I would have honored that commitment if the next opportunity hadn't been so enticing. Ari, a highly regarded senior from my FanDuel days, presented an irresistible pitch - a chance to play a pivotal role in a sports betting media startup desperately needing analytics support, [The Action Network](https://www.actionnetwork.com/). As his right-hand man, I'd be leading a small team of analysts, charged with developing reporting infrastructure across the media and affiliate branches of the business. Although I didn't feel as productive initially due to my short tenure, I managed to initiate some small projects that demonstrated my capabilities.

Drawing upon my experiences at FanDuel, I started developing daily and weekly reports to facilitate a better understanding of core metrics among business leaders. By capitalizing on the groundwork laid by other analysts and relentlessly questioning metrics definitions, I was able to establish an effective onboarding process. Creating visible, frequent reports provided a thorough comprehension of what drives the metrics, illuminating any inconsistencies and gaps, and offering quick solutions. 


# Sale to Better Collective and Immediate Aftermath


Only a month into my tenure at [Action Network](https://www.actionnetwork.com/), things felt somewhat amiss. I was involved in high-level strategy meetings for our burgeoning affiliate business, but the leadership dynamics were unclear. Unbeknownst to me, negotiations were ongoing to sell the company to [Better Collective](https://bettercollective.com/), a European sports betting affiliate platform. After the successful sale, Ari left for Fanatics, leaving me without a mentor and creating confusion about my reporting line and priorities. Despite this trying period, I managed to push through and learned invaluable lessons about self-advocacy and taking the initiative.

#### Description
I encountered a significant mismatch between our top-of-funnel KPI reporting (Google Analytics) and our product/revenue reporting (Redshift). I leveraged my experience with the Redshift-to-Google Sheets connection and integrated Google Analytics data to create a consolidated source of truth, albeit in an unwieldy Google Sheet. Google Data Studio became our saving grace, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the data.

### Audience Tracking

#### Description
With audience as the core KPI since the company's inception, demonstrating its growth and the expansion of the sports betting audience in the USA was essential. As we were preparing for acquisition by [Better Collective](https://bettercollective.com/), a company specializing in affiliate conversion, we had to improve our audience tracking methods. I introduced the DAU/MAU ratio and began monitoring platform performance differences, focusing on high-value, high-intent sessions rather than repetitive users.


# The First Year Post-Ari


The first few months after the acquisition were a trial by fire. Much of our time was spent trying to understand our new European counterparts and integrate our analytics processes and reporting. But the communication challenges were formidable, and without a strong unifying leadership figure, we were often left treading water. The struggle to unify our metric definitions, for instance, was surprisingly contentious, and we missed quick wins that could have come from a more immediate synthesis of our data.

The clearest lesson from this period was seeing the importance of strong, aligned leadership in facilitating cross-functional collaboration. However, it was also during this time that we saw a significant shift in our organizational focus from audience to user acquisition. I was deeply involved in facilitating this shift, taking charge of new reporting and analysis to drive the change. The result was the creation of an intricate user acquisition dashboard that tracked the success of our efforts in real time and helped guide our future strategies.

#### Description
In our evolving business environment, with a shift from focusing on audience to prioritizing revenue, nearly 40% of our company experienced a dramatic role change. This significant shift primarily affected our content team, led by the remarkable Chad, a savant in the sports media space who knew how to effectively guide a large team.

Chad was completely supportive of the shift from driving Monthly Active Users (MAUs) to boosting revenue. However, he was challenged with motivating his team. Previously, the team had a clear view of their direct impact on our core performance (via the volume of people reading their articles each month). But with the new focus on conversion further down the sales funnel, it became more difficult to discern the real impact of their efforts on our bottom line.

In collaboration with Chad and a few team leaders - Katie, Steve, and Andrew - we brainstormed and came up with the concept of a "Value Click." This idea examined the subsequent action a user took after reading an article, investigating whether it was predictive of a future subscription purchase or, better yet, a click on a promotional offer from a sportsbook.

While the "Value Click" was primarily used for motivational purposes at this stage and not directly tied to revenue, it marked a significant win for the team. The new metrics were split by platforms and sessions on each platform, which gave us a more granular understanding of user behavior.

Creating this custom metric was a considerable professional milestone for me. It wasn't my first time creating custom metrics, but it was the first time I ideated and led a project of this magnitude. I learned much about my technical abilities, having to write custom queries that tracked each session on each platform and understanding how Value Clicks manifested in the data.

More importantly, it forced me to attentively listen to a large team's needs and deliver a solution to enhance their performance. Through this project, we discovered correlated metrics like "articles read per reader" and "cross-sport readers" that had substantial impacts on our bottom line.

As the Director of Analytics, the teams at [Better Collective](https://bettercollective.com/) in Denmark naturally approached me to gain access to our data. While we didn't have a system in place to fully operationalize this data sharing, I undertook some work to automate daily reporting for their financial stack. This early encounter with Better Collective allowed me to experience the contrast between a startup's "move fast and break things" mentality and the more structured, deadline-driven approach of "I need this report on my desk in this specific format by tomorrow morning."

### Affiliate Performance Reporting
#### Key Technologies

#### Description
Our acquisition by [Better Collective](https://bettercollective.com/) was driven by a strong growth in affiliate-driven revenue over the previous year. As this growth continued, it became clear that our systems for tracking performance across all of our affiliate partners wouldn't scale if we continued to grow at the same pace. April advocated to hire Amanda, and they, along with Billy, played a pivotal role in developing infrastructure to automate the scraping and cleaning of data from nearly two dozen partners. They also presented the data in a way that resolved numerous issues for both Better Collective and Action management. During this project, I learned how to navigate high-pressure leadership situations and the importance of trusting my team to deliver high-quality products. This experience as a manager taught me valuable lessons that would inform my future leadership style.


# Year 2 Post-Merger


In the wake of the merger with [Better Collective](https://bettercollective.com/), our team was faced with the monumental task of meeting the revenue targets set as part of the deal. Alongside our own internal forecasts, we now had to answer to these higher expectations. However, by February of 2022, a sobering reality had set in - we weren't hitting our targets. The stress from this underperformance added pressure to our daily operations and pushed us to aggressively seek out additional affiliate partnerships.

I was mindful of the need to give the teams room to breathe, but the urgency of our situation left little room for reprieve. The immense strain we were under began to show, and morale within the company plummeted. This pressure eventually led to the departure of key team members. When Kristin, our Head of People, decided to leave, it marked the beginning of a mass exodus. Over a span of just five months, we lost a significant part of our team.

Looking back at this tumultuous period, I realize that it wasn't the lost deals or missed targets that were the most significant. Instead, it was the relationships with my team, the trust we built, and the morale we lost that affected me the most. I learned an invaluable lesson during this time: the importance of listening to and supporting my team. In the chaos of our situation, I realized that empowering my team should always take precedence over individual tasks, no matter how critical they might seem.

Despite these hurdles, the reality was that we still had to deliver on our commitments. The departure of team members meant that I had to pick up additional responsibilities. Working 70-80 hour weeks became the norm, and I found myself reporting directly to Melissa, our CFO for Better Collective in the US. The silver lining in this cloud was the strengthened bonds I formed with my remaining teammates. Their resilience and camaraderie reminded me of why I love being part of a team, and their support was instrumental in helping me navigate this challenging period.

### Affiliate Deal Forecasting

#### Description
In the early stages of our affiliate business, as sports gambling was gaining traction in states like New York, Michigan, and Colorado, the landscape was focused on acquiring as many customers as possible. At that time, we recognized all of our payment for referring a paying user to a sportsbook upfront, typically when that user made their first paid wager. This was an efficient model to start the engine of our partnerships and scale swiftly. However, as the market matured and our affiliate revenue outpaced other sources, some underlying issues with this business model became glaringly apparent.

The most significant concern was the sustainability of this acquisition-focused model. With each passing day, the pool of new users was shrinking, and our existing customer base was underutilized. We also recognized a misalignment of incentives with our core partners. As we were compensated solely for acquisition, we had little to no incentive to assist sportsbooks in retaining their users. This led to an untenable situation for sportsbooks, many of which were struggling to stay afloat due to the inflow of low-value customers that couldn't cover the acquisition fees we charged.

Acknowledging these challenges, we initiated a shift towards a more balanced and sustainable model - a revenue-share agreement. Under this new arrangement, we would receive a smaller upfront payment for acquiring the user, followed by a percentage of the user's losses incurred on the sportsbook over a three to five-year period. The shift promised to realign incentives, create a recurring revenue stream, and extract more value from our existing users. However, it posed a significant risk to our short-term revenue during a time when we were already facing financial challenges.

As a key player in this transition, my primary task was to build a compelling case for moving from the cost-per-acquisition model to the revenue-share model. The crux of this argument rested on the long-term financial gains we could realize through revenue sharing.

To model the lifetime value (LTV) of a user under the new model, I required actual user play data from our partners, along with a range of deal parameters to map against user behavior post-activation on the sportsbook. Fortunately, one of our major partners shared comprehensive, anonymized user-play data from customers we had referred over a 1.5-year period.

Using this data, I was able to create user cohorts and project their future play based on retention rates, loss rates, and the timing of their first activation. I then developed filters for various deal parameters (such as revenue-share term length, deal percentage, and upfront payment to us for acquisition), differentiated by the user's state to account for variations in tax impacts on user LTV.

Drawing on my concurrently developed state-level user acquisition forecasts, I then estimated how many users we would acquire and the resulting revenue under either a cost-per-acquisition deal or a revenue-share deal.

The culmination of these efforts was a successful presentation to our executive leadership team. I demonstrated how we could trade a high seven-figure revenue reduction in the second half of 2022 for a potential eight-figure revenue upside from 2023 to 2025 with one of our largest partners. I personally explained the rationale behind my user-level retention and losses forecasts, defended the decisions I made, and effectively used charts and graphs to illustrate the immense revenue potential in the clearest terms.

This significant project involved high stakes and complex modeling but ultimately showcased the power of data-driven decision-making in shaping our strategic direction.

#### Description
Having been satisfied with my previous work during the last football season, our content team was eager to amplify their operations. Despite the established correlation between value-clicks and revenue generation, the team faced difficulty linking control metrics such as Monthly Active Users (MAU), Daily Active Users (DAU), and sessions to value-clicks.

Upon conducting an analysis, I identified divergent user behaviours between our web and app platforms. Web users typically exhibited high bounce rates with low conversion, mostly seeking one-off content. Conversely, app users were inclined to subscribe or activate on a sportsbook proportional to their app usage duration. This led to the recognition of 'daily unique readers' on the web, and 'daily reads per reader' on the app as the primary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the forthcoming football season, due to their strong correlation with value clicks and subsequent revenue generation.

Subsequently, I developed a user-friendly tool on Google Sheets for the team to set reasonable monthly KPI targets by sport, aligned with our company's revenue objectives. The strong correlation between the identified audience KPIs and revenue generation gave me the confidence to establish these targets using a simple linear regression model. Our team, comprising Chad, Katie, Steve, Andrew, and Korey, then set their YoY improvement targets individually for each month and each sport for the September 2022 to December 2022 period. We convened three meetings over the subsequent fortnight, during which we amalgamated our targets and arrived at a consensus. Korey, a newly inducted analyst, took the lead in operationalizing these targets on Tableau.

The result was a well-articulated roadmap for the content team, highlighting clear objectives and tracking mechanisms to evaluate individual contributions towards our overarching corporate goals.

#### Description
The integration of our affiliate reporting with the broader Better Collective US emerged as a key priority as we pursued closer collaboration. This expanded scope involved managing multiple new layers of complexity, including various websites driving affiliate revenue, distinct deal types with partners, and a multitude of new partners. To tackle this, we started to build an internal data engineering team, migrating our processes from CRON jobs to an Apache Airflow system for enhanced data scrape monitoring and handling the added complexity.

However, with Billy, April, and Amanda leaving the company, the project responsibility fell upon myself and a junior analyst, Grant. We were tasked with writing thousands of lines of custom scripts for numerous partners, ensuring alignment with our revenue reporting schemas, all while lacking Python expertise. We built a working model that catered to most of our partners and rapidly hired replacements to assist with the project.

Ultimately, we developed a pipeline of scripts in Airflow using Python that accurately reported revenue for the majority of our partners. Our biggest challenge during the fall of 2022 was with partners unable to report accurately, which, nonetheless, was a more favourable problem compared to our situation in the spring of 2022.


# Football Season 2022 and Deciding to Leave


As the 2022 football season commenced, we were expanding our analytics team to scale up operations. We had established high-level targets for our key teams and were managing ad hoc requests as they arrived. My plan was primarily to guide the team and foster their growth, while addressing ad hoc needs as they arose. However, the underperformance during the initial weeks of the football season against our outdated revenue targets necessitated a complete reforecasting of our 3-5 year revenue plan during our busiest period.

The revised forecast revealed an unsettling short-term outlook. Even after significant adjustments by the finance team, we had to make several cuts, including headcount reduction, to stay afloat, given the drastic changes to our business model and general underperformance. A week after the 2023-2026 forecast completion, I was asked to let go of a recently hired analyst. Considering our previous struggles with headcount reduction and the already extended working hours of the team, I found this demand unacceptable and consequently resigned the next day.

Despite the challenging circumstances, I value my tenure at [Action Network](https://www.actionnetwork.com/) and [Better Collective](https://bettercollective.com/). It was a rich learning ground for leadership, team management during tough times, and the importance of resilience. While I regret not advocating more for my team, I am proud of the complex data projects we completed and the insight gained in explaining intricate machine learning concepts to business stakeholders.

#### Description
As I started working on the revenue forecast for all of [Better Collective](https://bettercollective.com/), it was essential to gain a thorough understanding of the audience patterns across our other properties. I set up custom Airflow pipelines to ingest daily user reporting into a single Redshift instance, aggregating all information into one master-level Redshift view. This view was then reported to Google Sheets for temporary usage.

This project involved engaging with various property owners, each with their own vested interests. They desired positive portrayals to Better Collective management, which led to challenging discussions when their growth expectations didn't match the reality portrayed by the data.


### Long-Term Revenue Forecasting

#### Description
Transitioning from the revenue-share deal modeling, I embarked on an ambitious project to shape our long-term revenue vision. The target: to design a model that predicts monthly revenue through 2026 on a state-by-state basis. This granular approach was pivotal due to our revenue's dependence on the legalization timeline of online gambling in each state.

My initial assumption was to base the model on the combination of each state's legalization timeline and the audience for each site/platform. However, exploratory data analysis surfaced a crucial insight: for most sites and platforms, state-level audience figures were heavily correlated with their respective legalization timelines. Consequently, audience numbers (monthly-active-users) had to be treated as an intermediary output, resulting from legalization, not a separate input to the overall model.

With this understanding, the model's design evolved into an integration of three sub-models, each addressing different facets of the business:

- **State Legalization to MAU Sub-Model:** This sub-model took the month of state legalization as input and predicted Monthly Active Users (MAU) as output. I developed this sub-model using Redshift queries, Google Analytics data, and scraped online data to infer the legalization timelines.

- **MAU to Affiliate Activations Sub-Model:** The output from the first model (MAUs) was then fed into this sub-model, which predicted affiliate activations by operator by state. This prediction was based on MAUs and the duration a state had been legal.

- **Activations to LTV and Revenue Sub-Model:** The third sub-model took forecasts of activations (by month, state, and operator) and estimated the Lifetime Value (LTV) of each user. This was then used to generate a cumulative revenue total over the next four years (through 2026).

Throughout the construction of these sub-models, I heavily relied on Python, Pandas, NumPy, and SciKit Learn to perform exploratory data analysis and highlight crucial factors for the modeling steps. All of this took place in various Jupyter notebooks.

This rigorous data analysis proved instrumental when explaining the model to stakeholders. For instance, justifying why one site's audience dropped when a state legalized online gambling (due to the site offering advice for fantasy sports, which were legal everywhere) was easier with data to support the claim.

After the models were constructed, I codified the formulas into a comprehensive Google Sheet, complete with filters. This allowed stakeholders to validate and agree on the assumptions that made sense to them.

The entire modeling process, which took about four weeks of intensive work (around 80 hours per week), was a massive undertaking that I'm incredibly proud of. Despite the business's reservations about my conclusions, the project taught me a lot about conveying unwelcome information to executives, highlighting the importance of hard data in such conversations. It also served as a lesson in trusting new teammates to efficiently pick up slack on other projects while I focused on this monumental task. While the finance team ultimately adjusted my projections upwards without much reasoning – to my chagrin – I stand by the effort and diligence I put into this project.
