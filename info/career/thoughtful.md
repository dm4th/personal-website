# Discovering Thoughtful

After a couple of months interviewing at different types of companies, I started to realize rat I was spending too much time working on a product with a friend of mine. Rather then research more problems to fall in love with, I felt like I had already found quite a good candidate. [DocWow](https://www.danielmathieson.com/info/projects/docwow) was getting a bit of traction as an appeals letter generator for health insurance denials for providers. Once I finished the MVP, I decided to search for competition in the AI - enabled RCM space. The first hit on my first google search was a company called Thoughtful AI. They had a solutions architect role open that I immediately applied for just to check it out. Chris at Thoughtful was the only hiring manager at the time that actually used my chat interface on this website to learn more about me. That spoke volumes for what he and Thoughtful were looking for, I had found my next step.
