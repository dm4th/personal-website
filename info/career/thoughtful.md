# Discovering Thoughtful

After a couple of months interviewing at different types of companies, I started to realize rat I was spending too much time working on a product with a friend of mine. Rather then research more problems to fall in love with, I felt like I had already found quite a good candidate. [DocWow](https://www.danielmathieson.com/info/projects/docwow) was getting a bit of traction as an appeals letter generator for health insurance denials for providers. Once I finished the MVP, I decided to search for competition in the AI - enabled RCM space. The first hit on my first google search was a company called Thoughtful AI. They had a solutions architect role open that I immediately applied for just to check it out. Chris at Thoughtful was the only hiring manager at the time that actually used my chat interface on this website to learn more about me. That spoke volumes for what he and Thoughtful were looking for, I had found my next step.

At the time, Thoughtful was still an RPA shop for any customer willing to pay. There was no vertical specialty play yet, we were still looking for product market fit. The role I was being hired for in particular sounded like a very general role, with an emphasis on problem solving and systems design. I was eager to get into a vary lucrative industry with problems to solve, and I turned out to be correct in my assumption. 


# Solutions Architect

My first role at Thoughtful was as a solutions architect. I would sit with our customers for hours on end, learning the ins and outs of their systems and processes. I'd then so into excruciating detail to outline a process for a team of offshore developers to automate. The documents we would create to specify those details were called a Master Automation Plan, or MAP for short. These documents were essentially pseudo-code complete with data structures and assembly-like instruction sets and syntax. We could automate anything either on-prem or in the cloud. 

As we built more automations, it became rather clear that healthcare, specifically revenue-cycle-management, would be our fastest and Best path to growth.
