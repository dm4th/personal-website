## What I'm Looking For


Overall I'm looking to work for a company or project that gets me jumping out of bed every morning. 
Over my career and the past few months I ahve cultivated a wide array of skills with varying degrees of expertise. While I'm confident that you'd struggle to find a more qualified data analyst than myself, I also acknowledge the fact that my machine learning and ariticifial intelligence skills are not as strong as my SQL and modeling skills. 
I've learned a lot about full-stack development, blockchain engineering, and what it takes to go from 0 to 1 on a product over the past few months. I just don't have actual carrer experience to back it up.
If you take anything away from this website I hope it's this: I'm willing to think outside the box to help you in any way I can. Hopefully this project demonstartes that for you.


## Weaknesses


I've had a lot of time to dissect what I think my key weaknesses are since I left the Action Network in October 2022. I think these will be more instructive of what I want in a role going forward than my strengths which is why I'm listing them first. While I think I would excel in a role that plays to my strenghts, I first want to make sure you understand my perceived weaknesses.
1. **People Pleasing** - I know this is a very "buzzword" weakness to start with, but I really attribute a lot of my failures as a manager at Action to my inabaility to say no. I was continuously praised and rewarded for my ability to solve everyone's problems early in my career. Because my saying yes to everyone's requests only impacted myself, I took every opportunity I could to help others. I loved it. This quickly turns into a weakness when other people are responsible for your saying yes though. In the right role I think I'd have a much better time working on this weakness of mine, paritcularly in a role with a deeper focus area or more clear responsibilities than I had at Action.
2. **Over-Engineering** - I love to deliver a polished product. If this website is anything its a testament to my inability to not just upload a resume to companies I'd like to work for or network. I'd rather spend my time building. But over-engineering also has it's drawbacks, including when there are very tight deadlines. The analyst in me recoils at the thought of delivering recommendations without enough data or analysis done, but at times that is what's required. I have worked ont his a lot over the years, but I still have a lot more work to do.
3. **Prioritization of People** - I find this to be a major weakness for most people I work with, I think it's important to call out here though. I have a hard time separating good ideas and good people (as well as bad ideas and bad people). Great ideas can come from someone who had delivered very little over a few months time, and its often difficult to separate your opinion of someone's aptitude from their day-to-day ideas. I realized this when I was working endless hours on longer term projects for people who I perceived as more important, when there were some very key projects for less important people that could ahve quickly moved the needle on our perofrmance. I think this issue is often solved more in a company/team's culture than by one person working on themselves, but I fell to this one a lot.


## Strengths


This section is a lot easier for anyone to write, me included. I've consistently found myself to be one of teh hardest working people on the teams I'm on as well as one of the most technically capable as well. I'll list three key strengths here, but I'm confident I can help your team/project/company in many more ways as well.
1. **Teaching** - I have an incredible ability to distill very complicated subjects down to easy to understand points. I did this at FanDuel when I expalined complicated Daily Fantasy ecosystem interactions to executives on a daily basis. At Google it took me less than a year to be teaching my coworkers how to better use the internal tooling available to them. At Action I spent all of my time teaching others, whether it be executives how to better understand their business, my team how to learn python, or the rest of the company how their work impacts our bottom line. And even while I've been taking classes I've been spending my free time teaching kids how to code. I'm someone you can put on a team and expect the rest of the team to improve as well.
2. **Curiosity** - I spent my off-time taking bootcamps in both AI/ML as well as blockchain engineering. When I ahve free time I'm listening to podcasts about tech, science, and business. And when I don't know how to solve a problem I will do everything I can to learn how to solve it.  In fact, I didn't know SQL before I started at FanDuel, and I not only learned that skill but I'm now an expert. Combined with my teaching ability I can assure you that working with me will be a fountain of knowldege that you can tap in to.
3. **High EQ** - I wouldn't consider myself the best manager of all time, not even close. Chris, the best manager I ever had, had this innate ability to know exactly what I needed before I did - something I'm working on. I definitely can tell you though that people always enjoyed working with/for me. I Love being a part of a team and a culture. A lot of people could add this as a strength of theirs as well, I really do think I excel at understanding other people though.
