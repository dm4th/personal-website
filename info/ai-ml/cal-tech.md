# AI/ML Bootcamp - Cal Tech



Throughout my career to this point I had spent most of my time working with rather large datasets, doing analyses that 90% of other people could not do themselves. There was always a small subset of problems I would come across though that I feel I needed a bit more training to do well. From my understanding I knew I didn't know enough technical algorithms and have the hard skills needed to truly be great at what I was doing before. I also knew AI/ML was what I needed to learn to take that next step,  and it didn't hurt that the field was quite popular at The time too.

I did some research and landed on a bootcamp for quite honestly the worst reasons.i didn't want a long term commitment because I didn't want to be out of the workforce for too long. I also didn't think I have the work ethic required to teach myself through YouTube videos and the online courses. I did some research online and found a great 6-month bootcamp through Cal Tech that seemed like the perfect fit. I should have trusted myself with free courses though. The bootcamp was fine, and it kept me honest, but the projects were too restrictive and there was too much stuff in the beginning of the course that I could have skipped over if I was self-pacing.
