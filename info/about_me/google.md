## Onboarding in Office

My initial plan after moving to the Bay Area was to live in corporate sponsored housing for as long as they'd let me before moving up to SF and commuting down to the office daily. This meant for the first few months I'd be biking distance from the google cloud campus, the perfect onboarding situation. I was super excited to work at such an important, large company, and really learn how things are done in tech.

The first few months were quite slow. There really wasn't a whole lot of work for me to do in the beginning, so I just spent my time digging through my coworkers' queries and dashboards, getting a sense for how subscription businesses work and what the key driving factors for performance were. I loved having the free time in the office though... who wouldn't at a campus like Google's?? I took advatnage of all the food, the gym, even the proximity to Sunnyvale was super nice. After 3 months my time in Sunnyvale was ending though, and not a moment too soon as I was getting kind of bored in a sleepier suburb and something else major was just around the corner...

## COVID Lockdowns

Right as I moved up to San Francisco, COVID locked down everything. The timing was so perfect that I cleaned out my desk on Friday, cleaned out my apartment the next day, and never once had to commute down to the south bay for my time at Google. The transition was difficult though, and I missed the perks and easy access to coworkers' knowledge of the office. In fact I felt rather useless for the first month or two - although that may have been a more widespread thought across more than just new people. I got my first chance to take over a projet about a month in to COVID though, as I took over some headcount planning work that was left by a coworker going on carer's leave.
- **Contractor Headcount Planning** - This was my first real project at Google, and it involved doing a lot of deep digging on different contractor rates for work in various countries. A big problem teams were having early on in COVID was making sure they weren't spending too much money on short-term contractors to fill in gaps that were left by full-time employees needing to take time off.
