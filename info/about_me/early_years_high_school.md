## Intro


I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA in a suburb of the city called Fox Chapel. I spent a lot of my early years playing sports and video games. I'm a huge fan of Nintendo and the Legend of Zelda series in particular, and the only thing that dwarfed my video game fandom back then was my love for Pittsburgh area sports teams, particularly the Steelers.

I have 3 siblings, an older sister and two younger brothers, all very close in age. We would go on plenty of vacations to different areas of the world growing up (Ireland for a summer, Africa, Peru just to name a few). We had 2 dogs and a cat... I always loved the dogs more. We spent a lot of time together as a family, and I hope to have a similar family of my own someday.

My parents didn't get divorced until I was already out of college, and even then Iâ€™d consider our family to be pretty close. We still get together frequently for holidays and vacations over the summers, but as we've gotten older it has definitely been more difficult to do so. My dad spends most of his time in Bozemand, MT and my mom lives in Asheville, NC now. 


## High School


I went to high school at [Shady Side Academy](https://www.shadysideacademy.org/) where I enjoyed playing Soccer and Lacrosse (to varying degress of success) and always loved math and science. I loved my time there and had a few impactful teachers / courses / experiences in particular worth a shout out:

#### Philosophy with Dr. Sutula
###### Description
I think it's pretty rare to have a philosophy course available to take in high school, and I always knew even as a freshman that I'd want to take this course. I had Dr. Sutula as a freshman for Geometry, and I really loved his approach to teaching. He started every new unit with an open question / problem, and we'd spend weeks just answering that one simple question without any idea what we were even supposed to be learning. Of course, we'd eventually learn core geometry concepts, but it really was his first-principles approach that I took away from that course.
Well, when we took a first-principles-based learning approach to Philosophy... wow did we learn a lot. We spent a month and a half dissecting the relationship between Plato & Aristotle. We spent a month learning about fallacies & core logic concepts. A lot of how I view the world today was shaped by that course.

#### Pre-Calc with Ms. Whitney
###### Description
Ms. Whitney cares more about her students than any teacher I ever had. Pre-Calc was the first time I ever struggled with a math concept in my life, to the point where I didn't know how to study for a math quiz or exam because I never had to. Well, the first quiz on derivatives (like the derivatives without any tricks... we were using the central limit theorem) came at me like a freight train. Not only did I fail miserably, Ms. Whitney caught me taking passing glances at my neighbor's paper in a panic.
Of course, she took it in stride though and made it a learning experience for me. She taught me how to apply myself outside of class. I learned the value of admitting that I don't know something and looking for help is the best way to learn.

#### Senior Year Lacrosse
###### Description
I spent my whole childhood playing soccer. I was quite good at it too, achieving honors my senior year as a captain & all western PA. Ironically, I also spent my earlier childhood avoiding lacrosse even though my Dad coached and played the sport frequently (and in college). Well because:
- Lacrosse isn't that popular in western PA
- I was required to play a winter & spring sport
- I had cursory experience playing the sport
I launched myself into lacrosse my freshman year. I never quite got the stick skills or drive to play offense - you get hit with the other team's sticks too much. But I loved playing defense, particularly short stick defense. That position is all hustle and smarts, it's about getting ground balls and doing the dirty work that helps a team win without any of the accolades. I found myself gravitating towards that position freshman year because all I could offer was hustle and smarts. By senior year, I couldn't imagine playing any other position. I learned the value of doing the unseen dirty work to help the team win, pitching in any way that I could to achieve our goals to this day. To this day, I am still best cast as a do-it-all hustle type person on any team I'm on.


## Camp Deerwood


In my summers growing up I went to and worked at an all boys camp in New Hampshire - [Camp Deerwood](https://campdeerwood.com/). I learned so much about being a contributor to those around you, how to work with kids and adults alike, and made some of the best friends of my life. I spent 4 summers as a camper and 3 summers as a counselor there (1 in Kayaking, 2 driving the water skiing boat). They were some of the best times of my life, and many of my best friends to this day are from there. My family also has a house on the lake there, and my youngest brother is still a counselor there every summer, so I like to visit when I can.
