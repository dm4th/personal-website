## Moving to New York City

Going through college I was pretty open to working anywhere but NYC. I grew up in a smaller city, went to college in an very small town, and I just thought that I'd get burned out if I tried to live in the city that never sleeps. Well an offer from my dream job changed those thoughts very quickly in the summer of 2016. I accepted a job while I was visiting family in San Francisco and was moving in with other family members in northern New Jersey two weeks later.
