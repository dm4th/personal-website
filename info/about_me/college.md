## The Search Process

Both of my parents went to (and met at) [Bucknell](https://www.bucknell.edu/). We had been there once or twice growing up as a family, and because of those experiences I always thought of Bucknell when I thought about what a college should look like. When it came time to look for where I'd spend my college years, I actually started off with "anywhere but Bucknell" so I could "chart my own path". Well, as I looked at every school I visited with my mom and my brother, the comparison was always to Bucknell. Combine that mental framework with a great engineering school and a strong liberal arts college, and my decision turned into a no-brainer after a bit of introspection.


## Picking a Major

When I first came onto campus, I was an undeclared engineering major. This is actually quite common at Bucknell and often encouraged because of a class all first-semester engineers take: Engineering 100. In fact, even for declared engineering majors, you'll take the same 4 courses no matter your major in the engineering college:
1. Calculus (level depending on potential AP credits)
2. Physics I
3. A Foundation Seminar (Graudation Requirement)
4. ENG 100
The ENG 100 course starts with a bit of "how to think like an engineer" in the beginning few weeks, but quickly jumps into the meat of the course. You are rotated through 3 disciplines over 9 weeks to expose students to the various types of engineering the school offers. The three rotations I had were Biomedical, Electrical, and Computer Science. I don't mean this in any way as a negative remark on Biomedical, but the other two were fascinating to me.
Computer Science was super compelling to me, but I didn't want to have to make my choice between that discipline and Electrical Engineering so early on in my time at Bucknell. I loved the logic of computer science, but the physical nature of electrical intrigued me as well. Luckily for me, there was a major, Computer Engineering, that had a similar enough curriculum to both majors that I could take the Computer Engineering curriculum until the end of my Sophomore year, and if I liked software more than hardware or vice versa, I could switch into either of the two more specialized majors without too much trouble.


## Computer Engineering

Well, we all know what people say about the best-laid plans - I never switched out of [CompE](https://coursecatalog.bucknell.edu/collegeofengineeringcurricula/areasofstudy/computerengineeringcpeg/#majortext). I loved that there were only 6 of us in the whole major by the time we graduated (the smallest major in the college of engineering), and that I learned everything from electrical signals to higher-level abstraction concepts like data structures. I loved knowing exactly how everything works in a computer. Some of my favorite courses were:
- **Operating Systems** - Where the rubber meets the road! I had a great teacher, and particularly loved multi-processing & threading that was introduced in this course.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** - This was really the first computer science course that opened the doors to how systems work under the hood. The different ways to benchmark algorithms, run-times, and storage considerations were fascinating to me.
- **Entrepreneurial Engineering** - This course taught me that it's not enough to simply dream up an idea... You need to execute as well. I entered a startup pitch competition with a group of non-engineers, and of course, that meant I was solely responsible for the technical side of things. I probably wasn't strong enough then to truly understand the complexities of what we pitched, but it was definitely a great learning experience.
- **Digital Systems & Circuits** - I loved circuit design. It's basically a math puzzle that you can make measurements on and find exactly whether you're right or wrong. This course took that to the next level though, where input AC signals needed to be processed to digital outputs and vice versa. I learned a lot about creative system design here.
I think overall this program was amazing. I learned a ton of different disciplines and how a lot of the digital world works around us. I think there's definitely a reason the Electrical and Computer Engineering department was recently ranked #2 in the country recently by U.S. News & World Report. Very well deserved.


## Senior Capstone Project

For seniors in all engineering majors, you have to complete a year-long, project-based capstone project. My major was grouped with the electrical department, and to cut to the chase, I got an all-star group of engineers to work with. I think I was the person in the group project that didn't pull his/her weight if we're being totally honest.
I was the project manager for a team that built a mobile gaming console. We called it MAGE and it came with a primitive Android app and 4 "nodes". These nodes could be re-configured based on any game you wanted to play. They had a gyroscope, a button, and lit up various colors as well. The team built 2 example games:
- **Bop-It** - Nodes would light up different colors and the app would tell you to "shake" or "press" or "flip" the node that lit up a certain color.
- **Capture the Nodes** - Nodes would be lit different colors, and pressing the node would change it to the other team's color. The team with the most nodes after a certain time period would win.
I learned a ton about leadership in this course. Like I said, I was not the smartest on the team. But I did learn how to get a group of extremely talented engineers rowing in the same direction toward a common goal.
