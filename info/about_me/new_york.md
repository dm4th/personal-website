## Moving to New York City

Going through college I was pretty open to working anywhere but NYC. I grew up in a smaller city, went to college in an very small town, and I just thought that I'd get burned out if I tried to live in the city that never sleeps. Well an offer from my dream job changed those thoughts very quickly in the summer of 2016. I accepted a job while I was visiting family in San Francisco and was moving in with other family members in northern New Jersey two weeks later.

I lived in Northern NJ for about 4 months before the commute got to be too much for me on a daily basis. I moved in with my previous college roommate in the Murray Hill area of Manhattan in December of 2016, just a few blocks walk from where the FanDuel offices were located in the Gramercy Park / Madison Square Park area.

## Early Years

NYC turned into the ultimate work-hard environment for me while I was there. You could feel the energy, and my roommate Zach was working so hard that he motivated me to keep up. Living in Murray Hill I was nearby to a few of my other good friends from college, and we had a lot of fun exploring the city together. I didn't get out of Manhattan very much outside of visiting family for holidays and summers. 

## The East Village

After about 2 years in the Murray Hill area Zach and I moved to the East Village to get a new experience. The apartment was a bit smaller and it definitely felt small once his girlfriend Cass moved in later on in our stay there, but I loved that aparatment. It ws sitll close to the office for me so I walked without having to take a subway every morning, and now that I understood the subways a bit better I could get anywhere from Union Square Park stations to the rest of NYC.

After a year and a half though, I was starting to miss some things. NYC was all about where you were eating and what bar you were going to after. I never really got outside in nature and I missed that a lot. As I was going through some career changes, meeting Maggie (my girlfriend), and my roommate was moving out, it felt like the perfect time to explore new oppotunities somewhere else. When a job in the Bay Area presented itself it was perfect for me, more outdoors but still a rather big city in San Francisco. I jumped on the chance to have Google pay to move me across the country and never looked back. I loved my time in NYC, but I think I like SF more :).
