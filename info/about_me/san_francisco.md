## Moving to the Bay Area


I moved to the Bay Area with the help of a Google moving stipend over teh holidays in 2019. Early on I lived down in Sunnyvale, CA right near the Google Cloud Sunnyvale campus. I had a lot of autonomy in what I was doing, and I was living hours away from anyone. I don't think I could have lasted much longer than the three months I spend there, I spent a lot of teh savings I had from not paying rent in traveling up to San Francisco frequently. I was having to cook dinner for myself more than I was used to and I kind of enjoyed that to be honest. Three months was the max that Google would pay for me to live in their corporate housing though, so I moved up to San Francisco just in time for COVID.


## Moving to San Francisco and COVID

The same weekend that the world shut down for COVID was the weekend that I moved in to my new house with 3 roommates in the Mission right next to Dolores Park. The first of my three roommates was Drew, my younger cousin who grew up in Marin. the other two roommates were Chris and Tarek who I quickly got to know as we were locked in a house all together for months on end. Luckily we all got along so great and are good friends to this day. In fact Chris and Tarek still live in that house and my girlfriend and I go there frequently to say hi.
COVID was tough on most people, but honestly I didn't mind it all that much at this time. I think it really helped me to ease in to living in a new city. Everyone else was also stuck at home so long-distance communication with old friends came easily. My girlfriend Maggie moved out to San Francisco just a few blocks away in the Castro early on in COVID after finishing up her senior year of college which made the transition and life in general during this time so much better as well.
I lived in the house with 3 other guys for 2 years. They were a few years younger than me and while I enjoyed the infusion of youth in my daily routine, I was ready to stp sharing one bathroom with 3 other guys. I moved out in August of 2022, just as I was starting to lose motivation with my job at Action. I loved the Mission, and if someone is looking to move to San Francisco from out of town it is a neighborhood I would highly recommend living in.


## The Richmond and Maggie


In August 2022 my girlfriend Maggie, our dog Winnie (a border collie), and I moved to our current home in the Richmond close to Clement Street. It's the perfect place to live with a dog, with Golden Gate park and the Presidio so close by, it's a dream for Winnie. Living with my girlfriend has made life so much better as well, as so many of the awkward, annoying situations about who has what stuff at which place just melts away when you can share things with your partner. We moved to the Richmond which is definitely quieter than the parts of teh city we just moved from (and foggier as well), but it's perfect for us.
It has definitely been an interesting transision period for me personally as well. I have spent the majority of the time in this new apartment taking classes and working at an after school coding teaching school for kids. Not having a full-time job is definitely not natural for me, I love having something to work on and roll around in my head at all times. But it's been an important growth period for me and I'm glad I took the time off. That being said... I'm ready for my next chapter.
