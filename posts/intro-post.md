# Hello World!
&nbsp;

I've always wanted to build a personal portfolio website.... Said no one ever.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Seriously though I have jsut taken about 6 months off from working in the **real world** and I think it's time I start to document some of the stuff I'm working on. I am keeping some of the example posts that "I" made while buuilding the initial version of this website as a POC for what I'll be doing going forward.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

These posts will be a collection of what I spent my time doing on a given day. I am currently working on finishing an AI course, working on a web3 focused identity/payments platform, and obviously messing with LLM's. I hope to educate if bot entertain you along the way!
