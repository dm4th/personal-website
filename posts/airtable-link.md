&nbsp;

Today I'll be adding a link to my personal Airtable base to this personal website. This is a great opportunity to share my jumping off point for this project of a personal website as well as teach myself (and you) something new.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

For these posts I'll share prompts I ask an AI agent (LLM) to try to help me along the way. Hopefully you'll learn how I think about promting these models and how to make them work for you!
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Enough intro - let's dive in:
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Learnings

1. GPT4 is great at getting started on a project but will struggle to understand how to help on a project you've already started

2. It can play catch up if you can provide as much context as you possibly can *(i.e. actually showing the code you're using and your directory structures)*

3. GPT4 will continue to try to make a solution work even when it has no hope unless you ask for alternative solutions. Often the second or third alternative will work, so don't hesitate to ask for alternatives after two or three errors.

### Step 1: Initial Prompting & Getting Familiar with the Problem Space


>**Me:** 

>Are you familiar with the NextJS personal website walkthrough intro project?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<div class="answer">
>**GPT4:** 

>As an AI language model, I am familiar with Next.js and its applications, including creating personal websites. However, since my knowledge was last updated in 2021, I may not be aware of the specific walkthrough or intro project you're referring to if it was created or updated after that time.

>Next.js is a popular React framework developed by Vercel, which offers features like server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and more. It's suitable for creating personal websites, blogs, and portfolios, among other applications.

>Here's a simple outline of how to create a personal website using Next.js:

>1. Install Node.js: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/.

>2. Create a new Next.js project: Open a terminal and run the following command to create a new Next.js project:

        npx create-next-app my-personal-website

>>Replace "my-personal-website" with your desired project name.

>3. Navigate to the project folder:

        cd my-personal-website

>4. Start the development server

        npm run dev 

>5. Customize your personal website: Next.js uses a file-based routing system. You can create new pages by adding .js or .tsx files in the pages folder. The default index.js file represents the homepage of your website.

>6. Add styles: You can use CSS Modules, styled-jsx, or any other CSS-in-JS library like styled-components or emotion to style your website. Next.js also supports global CSS
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*This is a basic, boilerplate response when you mention working on a NextJS project to the model*
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:** 

> Can I create a page that shares an airtable interface on my personal website in NextJS?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4:** 

>Yes, you can create a page on your Next.js personal website that integrates with Airtable. To do this, you'll need to use the Airtable API to fetch data and then display it on your website. Here's a step-by-step guide to create a page that shares an Airtable interface:

>1. Sign up for an Airtable account and create a base: Sign up at https://airtable.com/ if you haven't already. Create a base with the desired schema (fields and table structure).

>2. Get your Airtable API key: Go to https://airtable.com/account and find your API key. Make sure to keep this key secure, as it allows access to your Airtable data.

>3. Install the Airtable package: In your Next.js project, install the airtable package:

        npm install airtable

>4. Create a **'.env.local'** file in your Next.js project root and add your Airtable API Key and Base ID:

        AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key
        AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_airtable_base_id

>5. **Create a lib folder in your project and a new file called airtable.js inside it.** Add the following code to set up the Airtable API client and create a function to fetch data from a specific table:

        import Airtable from 'airtable';

        const apiKey = process.env.AIRTABLE_API_KEY;
        const baseId = process.env.AIRTABLE_BASE_ID;

        const base = new Airtable({ apiKey }).base(baseId);

        export async function getRecords(table) {
        const records = await base(table)
            .select({ view: 'Grid view' })
            .all();

        return records.map((record) => ({
            id: record.id,
            fields: record.fields,
        }));
        }

>6. In your Next.js page, use the getRecords function to fetch data from Airtable and display it. For example, **create a new file called airtable.js in the pages folder and add the following code:**

        import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
        import { getRecords } from '../lib/airtable';

        export default function AirtablePage() {
        const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);

        useEffect(() => {
            async function fetchData() {
            const data = await getRecords('YourTableName');
            setRecords(data);
            }
            fetchData

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*GPT4 stopped generating output here*
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:** 

> Can you continue generating this output?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4**

>Certainly! Here's the complete example of the **'airtable.js'** file in the pages folder:

        import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
        import { getRecords } from '../lib/airtable';

        export default function AirtablePage() {
        const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);

        useEffect(() => {
            async function fetchData() {
            const data = await getRecords('YourTableName');
            setRecords(data);
            }
            fetchData();
        }, []);

        return (
            <div>
            <h1>Airtable Data</h1>
            <table>
                <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Column 1</th>
                    <th>Column 2</th>
                    {/* Add more column headers as needed */}
                </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                {records.map((record) => (
                    <tr key={record.id}>
                    <td>{record.fields.Column1}</td>
                    <td>{record.fields.Column2}</td>
                    {/* Add more table cells to display other fields */}
                    </tr>
                ))}
                </tbody>
            </table>
            </div>
        );
        }

>Replace **'YourTableName'** with the actual name of the table you want to fetch data from. Also, replace *Column1, Column2, etc.*, with your Airtable column names.

>This code will fetch data from your Airtable table using the getRecords function and display it in a simple HTML table. You can customize the UI and styling as needed for your personal website.

>Remember to import CSS or use your preferred styling approach to style the table and other elements on the page.

*At this point I'm realizing reading this text in my current markdown styling is going to be such a headache...*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Step 2: Making this Markdown Text Legible
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:** 

> Thanks for this output I'll definitely use it in my project shortly. I'm using the output you generate to create a walkthrough on the internet for other people to follow along as well. I'm having trouble styling the markdown file - specifically the code blocks you have generated as well as creating clean transitions between my queries and your answers. Could you help me style the markdown such that:

>1. The code has the correct coloring depending on the programming language used.
>2. There is a difference in text background shading between my questions and your answers
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4**

>I'm glad that the previous output is helpful for you! When it comes to styling a markdown file, there are limitations on what you can do directly within the markdown syntax. Markdown files don't support custom styles or syntax highlighting out-of-the-box, but you can achieve the desired outcome with some third-party tools or by using platforms that automatically apply styles to your markdown content.

>Here are two approaches to achieve your goals:

>1. Use a platform that supports syntax highlighting and custom styles:
Many platforms, like GitHub, GitLab, or popular static site generators (e.g., Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll) have built-in syntax highlighting for code blocks and apply default styles to markdown content. You can also use custom CSS to adjust the appearance of the text, code blocks, and other elements.

>2. Use an external JavaScript library for syntax highlighting:
One popular library for syntax highlighting is Prism.js (https://prismjs.com/). You can use it to add syntax highlighting to your code blocks when your markdown is converted to HTML. This approach requires you to have control over the HTML and CSS of the page where your markdown content is displayed.

>Regarding the difference in text background shading between questions and answers, you can achieve this by wrapping the questions and answers in custom HTML tags (e.g., **<div>**) with specific CSS classes when you convert the markdown to HTML.

>Here's an example of how you can structure your markdown file:

        # My Walkthrough

        <div class="question">

        ## User Question

        What is Next.js?

        </div>

        <div class="answer">

        ## ChatGPT Answer

        Next.js is a popular React framework developed by Vercel...

        </div>

>You can then style the **.question** and **.answer** classes in your CSS file:

        .question {
        background-color: #

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*GPT4 stopped generating output here*
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:** 

> Can you continue to generate the css response above?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4**

>I apologize for the incomplete response. Here's the complete CSS example for styling the questions and answers:

        .question {
        background-color: #f0f0f0;
        padding: 1rem;
        border-radius: 8px;
        margin-bottom: 1rem;
        }

        .answer {
        background-color: #e0e0e0;
        padding: 1rem;
        border-radius: 8px;
        margin-bottom: 1rem;
        }

>These CSS rules will apply background colors and padding to the questions and answers, making them visually distinct. You can customize the colors, padding, margins, and other styling properties to match your design preferences.

Remember that this approach requires your markdown content to be converted to HTML and displayed on a webpage where you have control over the HTML and CSS. This way, you can add custom styles to questions and answers and use a library like Prism.js for syntax highlighting in code blocks.>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*At this point I tried doing the HTML & CSS solution above. It seems like adding HTMl tags to the markdown would make them disappear from the DOM of the webpage, so I asked if there were alternative solutions*
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:** 

> I tried adding html syntax into my markdown file and it took the text I had previously written out of the output completely. Do you have any other ideas on how I can try to style these markdown files myself?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4**

>You can try using blockquotes to visually differentiate between questions and answers in your markdown file. Although this method doesn't offer the same level of customization as using HTML and CSS, it can help create a visual distinction without relying on external tools or platforms.

Here's an example of how to use blockquotes for questions and answers:

        # My Walkthrough

        > **User Question:** What is Next.js?

        **ChatGPT Answer:** Next.js is a popular React framework developed by Vercel...

        > **User Question:** How do I create a new Next.js project?

        **ChatGPT Answer:** You can create a new Next.js project by running the following command...

>This approach uses the **>** character to create blockquotes for user questions and regular bold text for ChatGPT answers. Most markdown processors will render blockquotes with a different style, which should help differentiate between questions and answers.

>However, note that this approach doesn't solve the syntax highlighting issue for code blocks. For that, you will still need to rely on platforms with built-in syntax highlighting (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) or use an external JavaScript library like Prism.js when rendering the markdown as HTML.

>If you'd like to use HTML tags within the markdown file, ensure that your markdown processor supports inline HTML. Some processors might strip HTML tags or not render them as expected. If you're using a static site generator or a specific platform, you can consult their documentation for details on using inline HTML in markdown files.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*I'm already using the syntax suggestions that GPT4 is offering - I'll try to get it to describe and potentially add prism.js to my project*
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:** 

> I'm already styling my markdown with blockquotes - I think I can still do better though. Could you explain prism.js to me and how it may help me style inline markdown in my project?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4**

>Prism.js is a lightweight, extensible syntax highlighter that can be used to style code blocks in your web pages. Although it doesn't directly style markdown files, you can use it to enhance the appearance of your code blocks when your markdown content is converted to HTML.

>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Prism.js in your project:

>1. Include the necessary Prism.js files in your HTML:

>Download Prism.js from https://prismjs.com/download.html. Make sure to select the languages you want to highlight.

> Include the **prism.js** and **prism.css** files in your HTML file's **<head>** section:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                ...
                <link href="path/to/prism.css" rel="stylesheet" />
                <script src="path/to/prism.js"></script>
                ...
            </head>
            <body>
                ...
            </body>
        </html>

>Replace **path/to/** with the actual path to your **prism.js** and **prism.css** files.

>2. Use the appropriate language class when writing code blocks in your markdown:

>When writing code blocks in your markdown file, specify the language you're using with the **language-** prefix in the class attribute. Prism.js will use this information to apply the correct syntax highlighting.

For example, if you're writing a JavaScript code block:

        <pre>
            ```html
                &lt;script&gt;
                console.log('Hello, World!');
                &lt;/script&gt;
            ```
        </pre>

>3. Convert your markdown to HTML:

>When you convert your markdown to HTML, the code blocks will have the appropriate class attribute for Prism.js to work. Use a markdown parser that supports converting markdown to HTML, like **marked** (https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) for Node.js, or other parsers available for your specific platform.

>4. Load your HTML content in the browser:
When you load the HTML content in your browser, Prism.js will automatically apply syntax highlighting to the code blocks based on the specified language.

>Keep in mind that Prism.js only helps with styling code blocks in your converted HTML content. It doesn't directly style the markdown files themselves. To differentiate between questions and answers, you'll need to rely on blockquotes or other markdown formatting techniques.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*I know from the previous work I've done on my website that I'm using **remark** from gray-matter to convert the markdown text into html: Here is where I'll give a lot more context to GPT4 to get it closer to what I need now that I know it wants to use a specific package to help.*
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:** 

> I'm using remark imported from the gray-matter npm library to generate my HTML posts from markdown. The NextJS code I use to generate a page is:

        import Head from 'next/head';
        import Layout from '../../components/layout';
        import Date from '../../components/date';
        import utilStyles from '../../styles/utils.module.css';
        import { getAllPostIds, getPostData } from '../../lib/posts';

        export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
        const postData = await getPostData(params.id);
        return {
            props: {
            postData,
            }
        };
        }

        export async function getStaticPaths() {
        const paths = getAllPostIds();
        return {
            paths,
            fallback: false
        };
        }

        export default function Post({ postData }) {
        return (
            <Layout>
            <Head>
                <title>{postData.title}</title>
            </Head>
            <article>
                <h1 className={utilStyles.headingXl}>{postData.title}</h1>
                <div className={utilStyles.lightText}>
                <Date dateString={postData.date}/>
                </div>
                <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: postData.contentHtml}} />
            </article>
            </Layout>
        );
        }

>the custom function I use to get the Post Data from the posts markdown files is:

        import fs from 'fs';
        import path from 'path';
        import matter from 'gray-matter';
        import { remark } from 'remark';
        import html from 'remark-html';

        const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');

        export function getSortedPostsData() {
        // Get file names under /posts
        const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);
        const allPostsData = fileNames.map((fileName) => {
            // Remove ".md" from file name to get id
            const id = fileName.replace(/\.md$/, '');

            // Read markdown file as string
            const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName);
            const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');

            // Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section
            const matterResult = matter(fileContents);

            // Combine the data with the id
            return {
            id,
            ...matterResult.data,
            };
        });
        // Sort posts by date
        return allPostsData.sort((a, b) => {
            if (a.date < b.date) {
            return 1;
            } else {
            return -1;
            }
        });
        }

        export function getAllPostIds() {
        const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);
        return fileNames.map((fileName) => {
            return {
            params: {
                id: fileName.replace(/\.md$/, ''),
            },
            };
        });
        }

        export async function getPostData(id) {
        const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${id}.md`);
        const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');

        const matterResult = matter(fileContents);

        const processedContent = await remark().use(html).process(matterResult.content);
        const contentHtml = processedContent.toString();

        return {
            id,
            contentHtml,
            ...matterResult.data
        }
        }
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4**

>To integrate Prism.js with your existing Next.js project and gray-matter, follow these steps:

>1. Install Prism.js and its required packages:

        npm install prismjs prism-react-renderer

>2. Create a new component for rendering code blocks with syntax highlighting. Create a new file called **CodeBlock.js** inside the components folder and add the following code:

        import React from 'react';
        import Prism from 'prismjs';
        import 'prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow.css'; // Import the theme you want to use

        export default function CodeBlock({ language, value }) {
        const html = Prism.highlight(value, Prism.languages[language], language);

        return (
            <pre className={`language-${language}`}>
            <code dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />
            </pre>
        );
        }

>3. Replace the remark-html plugin with remark-prism in your **getPostData** function. First, install the required package:

        npm install remark-prism

>Then, update your **getPostData** function in **lib/posts.js**:

        import fs from 'fs';
        import path from 'path';
        import matter from 'gray-matter';
        import remark from 'remark';
        import prism from 'remark-prism'; // Import the remark-prism package

        // ... other code

        export async function getPostData(id) {
        const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${id}.md`);
        const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');

        const matterResult = matter(fileContents);

        // Use remark-prism instead of remark-html
        const processedContent = await remark().use(prism).toString(matterResult.content);
        const contentHtml = processedContent;

        return {
            id,
            contentHtml,
            ...matterResult.data
        }
        }

>4. Finally, in your **pages/[id].js** file, update the content rendering to use the **CodeBlock** component for code blocks:

        import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown';
        import CodeBlock from '../../components/CodeBlock'; // Import the CodeBlock component

        // ... other code

        export default function Post({ postData }) {
        return (
            <Layout>
            <Head>
                <title>{postData.title}</title>
            </Head>
            <article>
                <h1 className={utilStyles.headingXl}>{postData.title}</h1>
                <div className={utilStyles.lightText}>
                <Date dateString={postData.date}/>
                </div>
                {/* Use ReactMarkdown and CodeBlock to render content */}
                <ReactMarkdown components={{ code: CodeBlock }}>
                {postData.contentHtml}
                </ReactMarkdown>
            </article>
            </Layout>
        );
        }

>With these changes, your Next.js project should now render code blocks with syntax highlighting using Prism.js. Note that this configuration will use the default Prism.js theme. If you want to use a different theme, download it from the Prism.js website or use a different import statement in the **CodeBlock.js** file.

&nbsp;

*For completeness I did exactly as it asked even though it's asking me to use a package (ReactMarkdown) that I know I don't ahve installed yet. I'll ask it to fix the error.*

### Step 3: Debugging Errors with GPT4
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:** 

>I made the changes you suggested and got an error after I tried to run *npm run dev* in my console:

        Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-markdown'
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4**

>Apologies for the confusion. It appears that you haven't installed the **react-markdown** package yet. You can install it by running the following command:

        npm install react-markdown

>Once you've installed the package, you should be able to run **npm run dev** without encountering the "Module not found" error.

>The **react-markdown** package is used to render the markdown content as HTML and allows you to use custom components like the **CodeBlock** component for code blocks with syntax highlighting using Prism.js.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:** 

>I installed the package and tried to rerun npm run dev:

        TypeError: (0 , remark__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__.default) is not a function

>The error occured in the **lib/posts.js** file on line 57

        const processedContent = await remark().use(prism).toString(matterResult.content);
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4:** 

>Apologies for the confusion. It appears that the import statement for **remark** is incorrect. You should change the import statement from **import { remark } from 'remark';** to **import remark from 'remark';**.

>Update the import statement in your **lib/posts.js** file:

        import fs from 'fs';
        import path from 'path';
        import matter from 'gray-matter';
        import remark from 'remark'; // Change the import statement
        import prism from 'remark-prism';

        // ... other code

>After making this change, the error should be resolved, and you should be able to run **npm run dev** without any issues.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:** 

>The import statement already looked like that. The alternative **import { remark } from 'remark';** also threw an error
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4:** 

>I apologize for the confusion. It appears there's an issue with how we're using the remark library. Let's update the **getPostData** function in the **lib/posts.js** file as follows:

    // ... other imports

    import unified from 'unified';
    import parse from 'remark-parse';
    import stringify from 'remark-html';
    import prism from 'remark-prism';

    // ... other code

    export async function getPostData(id) {
    const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${id}.md`);
    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');

    const matterResult = matter(fileContents);

    // Use unified, parse, prism, and stringify
    const processedContent = await unified()
        .use(parse)
        .use(prism)
        .use(stringify)
        .process(matterResult.content);

    const contentHtml = processedContent.toString();

    return {
        id,
        contentHtml,
        ...matterResult.data
    };
    }

>In this updated code, we use the **unified** library along with **remark-parse**, **remark-prism**, and **remark-html** to process the markdown content with syntax highlighting from Prism.js. Make sure you have these packages installed:

        npm install unified remark-parse remark-html

>After making these changes, you should be able to run **npm run dev** without any issues.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:** 

>It seems like we're making progress but there's still an error after making these changes:

        TypeError: (0 , unified__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4__.default) is not a function

>This is happening in **lib/posts.js** on line 60:

        const processedContent = await unified()
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4:** 

>My apologies for the confusion. It seems that the issue is with the import statement for **unified**. We can resolve this by changing the import statement to use **require** instead. Update the **lib/posts.js** file as follows:

>1. Change the import statements for **unified**, **parse**, **stringify**, and **prism** to use **require**:

        // ... other imports

        const unified = require('unified');
        const parse = require('remark-parse');
        const stringify = require('remark-html');
        const prism = require('remark-prism');

        // ... other code

>2. Make sure you have the required packages installed:

        npm install unified remark-parse remark-html remark-prism

>After making these changes, the error should be resolved, and you should be able to run **npm run dev** without any issues.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*At this point GPT4 is just guessing, which is candidly exactly what I would do. Changing the import statements won't work like this in NextJS, and making that change actually returns a **Module Not Found* error. Let's try to get GPT4 back on track.*
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:**

>That resulted in a module not found error. Do you think there could be an issue with the Webpack? Two of the errors have been:

        TypeError: (0 , remark__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__.default) is not a function
        TypeError: (0 , unified__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4__.default) is not a function
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
>**GPT4:**

>I apologize for the confusion, and you are correct that the issue is related to Webpack and the way it handles imports. Since you're using Next.js, which relies on Webpack, we can take a different approach using the **esm** module, which enables ES modules in Node.js.

>1. Install the esm package:

        npm install esm

>2. Update your **lib/posts.js** file to use **esm** for importing the required packages:

        // posts.mjs
        import fs from 'fs';
        import path from 'path';
        import matter from 'gray-matter';
        import unified from 'unified';
        import parse from 'remark-parse';
        import stringify from 'remark-html';
        import prism from 'remark-prism';

        // ... other code

>3. Rename your **lib/posts.js** file to **lib/posts.mjs**. The **.mjs** extension indicates that the file is an ES module.

>4. Update the import statement for the **lib/posts** module in your **pages/[id].js** file:

        // pages/[id].js
        import { getAllPostIds, getPostData } from '../../lib/posts.mjs'; // Update the import statement

        // ... other code

>By using the **esm** package and the **.mjs** extension, we tell Node.js to treat these files as ES modules, and it should resolve the import issues. After making these changes, you should be able to run **npm run dev** without any problems.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

*I'd prefer not to use esm modules to remain in the NextJS framework if possible. Overall I'd also like to point out how GPT4 is adding that I should be able to run **npm run dev** without issues throught this debugging process - that's how I typically know it's trying to simply fix my issue without maintaining perfect context of a situation*
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**Me:**

>Is there another solution to this problem? I'd like to handle my js within the NextJS framework if possible?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>**GPT4:**

>Certainly! Let's try another solution using the dynamic import feature in Next.js to import and use **unified** and the related plugins in the **getPostData** function.

>1. Revert the changes made previously to the **lib/posts.js** file and remove the ESM-related modifications. Your file should look like this:

        import fs from 'fs';
        import path from 'path';
        import matter from 'gray-matter';

        const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');

        // ... other code

        export async function getPostData(id) {
            const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${id}.md`);
            const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');

            const matterResult = matter(fileContents);

            // Leave the content processing part empty for now
            let contentHtml = '';

            return {
                id,
                contentHtml,
                ...matterResult.data
            }
        }

>2. In your **pages/[id].js** file, update the **getStaticProps** function to use dynamic imports for **unified**, **remark-parse**, **remark-html**, and **remark-prism**. Then, process the markdown content with syntax highlighting from Prism.js.

    // pages/[id].js
    import Head from 'next/head';
    import Layout from '../../components/layout';
    import Date from '../../components/date';
    import utilStyles from '../../styles/utils.module.css';
    import { getAllPostIds, getPostData } from '../../lib/posts';

    export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
    const postData = await getPostData(params.id);

    // Dynamically import required packages
    const unified = (await import('unified')).default;
    const parse = (await import('remark-parse')).default;
    const stringify = (await import('remark-html')).default;
    const prism = (await import('remark-prism')).default;

    // Process markdown content
    const processedContent = await unified()
        .use(parse)
        .use(prism)
        .use(stringify)
        .process(postData.content);

    const contentHtml = processedContent.toString();

    return {
            props: {
            postData: {
                ...postData,
                contentHtml, // Add the processed contentHtml to postData
            },
            },
        };
    }

    // ... other code

>By using dynamic imports, you can avoid issues with Webpack when importing and using the **unified** library and its plugins. After making these changes, you should be able to run **npm run dev** without any issues.
